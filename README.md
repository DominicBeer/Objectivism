# Objectivism

A plugin for implementing objects in Grasshopper.

Find some examples in the "Examples" folder

Open "Objectivism User Guide.pdf" to find out about using Objectivism. (this is a little out of date, new features, e.g. "Inherit" are not in there yet).

Find it on Food4Rhino or on the package manager

Plugin is currently tested with "semi-automatic" grasshopper script.
